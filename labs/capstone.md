### **Scenario:**

You’ve been hired as a consulting team to advise a mid-sized financial services firm, **FinTechCo**, on modernizing their software delivery process using DevOps principles. FinTechCo is experiencing slow release cycles, poor communication across departments, and rising compliance risks. Executive leadership wants to understand how DevOps can help improve business agility, reduce costs, and ensure quality across product lines.

They’ve asked you to create a **high-level DevOps Transformation Strategy** and present it to the executive leadership team.

### **Your Task:**

Each team will develop a **strategic DevOps overview** based on the themes and practices learned throughout the course and the Week 4, 8, and 12 labs. Focus on metrics, value delivery, and executive-level priorities. You do not need to provide technical implementation steps.

Each team must deliver the following:

#### 1. **DevOps Executive Overview**

* Clear definition of DevOps in business terms

#### 3. **High-Level Strategy Roadmap (Quarter-by-Quarter View)**

* Timeline showing major milestones over the next 12 months
* Key initiatives (e.g., pilot teams, training, tooling, cultural changes)
* Dependencies or risks

#### 4. **Proposed DevOps Metrics Dashboard (Summary View)**

* Select 4–6 KPIs based on what was learned in the labs
* Explain why these metrics matter to executives
* Suggest how results should be interpreted or acted upon

#### 5. **Final Presentation**
