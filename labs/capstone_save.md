## Capstone Project: DevOps Metrics Strategy for FinTrust Corp

### Scenario:

Your team has been engaged by **FinTrust Corp**, a mid-sized financial services firm aiming to modernize its software delivery processes. The company has recognized the need to implement DevOps practices to enhance efficiency, reduce time-to-market, and improve product quality. However, they lack a clear strategy for measuring and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor progress and drive continuous improvement.

### Objectives:

Develop a comprehensive DevOps metrics strategy that includes:

1. **Identification of Key Metrics**: Determine which DevOps metrics are most relevant to FinTrust Corp's goals. These may include:

   * Deployment Frequency
   * Lead Time for Changes
   * Change Failure Rate
   * Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
   * Other relevant metrics as identified in the labs and course discussions.

2. **Dashboard Design**: Propose a dashboard layout that effectively visualizes the selected metrics. Consider the following:

   * Clarity and simplicity for executive stakeholders.
   * Ability to drill down into specific areas for detailed analysis.
   * Real-time data updates and alerts for critical thresholds.

3. **Implementation Plan**: Outline the steps required to implement the dashboard, including:

   * Data sources and integration methods.
   * Tools and technologies recommended (e.g., Excel, Power BI, Tableau).
   * Roles and responsibilities for maintaining the dashboard.

4. **Analysis and Recommendations**: Provide an analysis of how the selected metrics will help FinTrust Corp achieve its objectives. Offer recommendations for:

   * Setting targets and benchmarks.
   * Responding to metric trends and anomalies.
   * Continuous improvement practices based on metric insights.

### Deliverables:

* **Executive Summary**: A brief document summarizing the proposed metrics strategy, dashboard design, and expected benefits.
* **Dashboard Mockup**: A visual representation of the proposed dashboard, created using tools like Excel or PowerPoint.
* **Implementation Plan**: A step-by-step guide detailing how to build and deploy the dashboard.
* **Presentation**: A 10-minute presentation to FinTrust Corp's leadership team outlining the strategy and answering potential questions.

### Team Structure:

Three groups, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project:

* **Group A**: Metrics Identification and Analysis
* **Group B**: Dashboard Design and Visualization
* **Group C**: Implementation Planning and Recommendations

Each group will collaborate to ensure cohesion across all deliverables and present their findings collectively.
